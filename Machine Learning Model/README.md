# Automatidata: Build a Machine Learning Model

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model using tree-based modeling techniques to predict a binary target class. The primary objective is to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers by predicting whether a customer is a generous tipper.

The project consists of three main parts:

1. **Ethical Considerations**: In this section, we address the ethical implications of the model, assess the consequences of potential errors, and explore whether the model's objective should be adjusted.

2. **Feature Engineering**: This part involves feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling.

3. **Modeling**: Here, we build machine learning models, evaluate their performance, and provide recommendations for next steps.

## Part 1: Ethical Considerations

### Objective Adjustment

We begin by considering the ethical implications of our model's objective, which is to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. We analyze the potential consequences of the model making false negatives and false positives. It's essential to evaluate whether the benefits of the model outweigh the potential problems.

**Key Findings:**
- Drivers may be upset if they don't receive tips as predicted.
- Customers might have difficulty finding a taxi.
- Even when the model is correct, it could limit accessibility for those who can't afford to tip.

### Objective Modification

To address these concerns, we explore the option of modifying the modeling objective. Instead of predicting customers who won't tip at all, we consider predicting particularly generous customers (those who will tip 20% or more). This approach may help increase drivers' earnings from tips while preventing the exclusion of certain individuals from using taxis.

**Key Findings:**
- We discuss the features required for this prediction.
- We define the target variable as a binary variable (1 or 0) indicating whether the customer is expected to tip â‰¥ 20%.
- It's a supervised learning classification task, and we mention the relevant evaluation metrics.

## Part 2: Feature Engineering

In this section, we discuss feature selection, extraction, and transformation necessary to prepare the data for modeling. Feature engineering is a crucial step to ensure our model's success.

**Additional Feature Ideas:**
- Behavioral history for each customer, including past tipping behavior.
- Times, dates, and locations of both pickups and dropoffs.
- Estimated fares and payment methods.
- Creation of new features, such as trip distance categories and ratios related to fare amounts.

## Part 3: Modeling

This part involves building machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and providing recommendations for next steps. We discuss the most effective model and examine feature importance.

**Key Findings:**
- Discussion of the recommended model.
- Examination of the model's performance metrics.
- Exploring the transparency of the random forest model.
- Suggested next steps, including potential new features.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we weigh the performance of our models and recommend the use of the modified objective that predicts generous customers rather than those who won't tip. While there is room for improvement with additional data and feature engineering, the model shows promise in improving taxi drivers' earnings from tips.
